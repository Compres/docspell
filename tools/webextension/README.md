# Webextension for Docspell

Idea: Inside the browser click on a PDF and send it to docspell. It is
downloaded in the context of your current page. Then handed to an
application that finally pushes it to docspell.

Please see the
[microsite](https://docspell.org/doc/tools) for
instructions or navigate to the corresponding [markdown
file](../../modules/microsite/src/main/tut/doc/tools.md#webextension-for-docspell).
